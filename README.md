## Introduction

This repository contains [Helm](https://helm.sh) charts for various projects. The charts are available in the [thesoftwaregeek Helm Charts Repository](https://thesoftwaregeek.github.io/helm-charts).

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repository as follows:

```bash
helm repo add thesoftwaregeek https://thesoftwaregeek.github.io/helm-charts
```

You can then run `helm search repo thesoftwaregeek` to see the charts.

### Installing a Chart

To install a chart, use the following command:

```bash
helm install my-release thesoftwaregeek/<chart-name>
```

For example:

```bash
helm install my-argo-cd thesoftwaregeek/argo-cd
```

### Using OCI Registry

Our charts are also available as OCI artifacts. You can pull them directly from our GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
# Pull a specific chart version
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/thesoftwaregeek/charts/<chart-name> --version <version>

# Example

```

You can also install directly from the OCI registry:
